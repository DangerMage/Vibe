# ----------------------------------
# Global Configuration
#
# There are values that are nice and easy to configure using this file format.
# The default values are shown below.
# This file can be named whatever, and can have filters in it. This just creates a dictionary named 'globals' internally.
# Having 'globals' in multiple places will throw an error.
